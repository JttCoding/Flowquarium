# You can relax, my friend

# [ODYSSEUS, spoken]
# Huh?

# [POLITES]
# I can tell you're getting nervous
# So do yourself a service
# And try to relax, my friend

# [ODYSSEUS]
# I'm fine, Polites

# [POLITES]
# Think of all that we have been through
# We'll survive what we get into

# I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
# Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
# Look at how you grip your sword, enough said
# Why should we take when we could give?
# You can show a person that you trust them
# When you stop and lower your guard
# Here we havе a chance for some adjustment
# Givе it a try, it's not that hard
# I'm telling you

# This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
# Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
# No matter the place, we can light up the world
# Here's how to start
# Greet the world with open arms
# Greet the world with open arms

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]

# We're only here for food

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# Food

# [ODYSSEUS]
# Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# Food

# [ODYSSEUS]
# Stay back, I'm warning you

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# Food (Num num num)

# [ODYSSEUS]
# If we don't get back safely
# My men will turn this place into blazes

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# Here you go

# [POLITES]
# See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
# Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
# No matter the place, we can light up the world
# Here's how to start
# Greet the world with open arms
# Greet the world with open arms

# [ODYSSEUS]
# My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
# But look at the way this fruit is glowing
# And filled with glowing seeds
# It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
# It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
# That's what we'd get with open arms


# [POLITES]
# Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
# Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# The cave (Scary cave)

# [POLITES]
# A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
# And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# East (That way)

# [POLITES, spoken]
# Thank you

# [LOTUS EATERS, spoken]
# Welcome

# [POLITES]
# This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
# I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
# So why not replace it and light up the world?
# Here's how to start
# Greet the world with open arms
# Greet the world with open arms

# [ODYSSEUS]
# Greet the world with open arms

# [POLITES]
# You can relax, my friend
